  <h2 class="display-4">What is this?</h2>
  <p class="lead">I have a Personal Project, which is to make learning to code easier, even if it is easy for some already. I came across a coding resource called <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy</a> and I thought it very helpful and generally fun to use. <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy</a> taught the user about Flexbox which is related to CSS, of course I had tried many other course type learning but none of them had the enjoyment and engagement that <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy</a> had. They weren't fun, engaging or had any form of informality to it. <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy</a> was so simple as it just required you to move frogs to their dedicated lilly pads. I believe that there should be more coding resources like <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy</a> I am a student who is doing the IB Personal Project, and I am using my knowledge of coding to try and make more courses like
  <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank">FlexBox Froggy.</a> I am still a learning front end web-developer and I have the full intent of continuing this project past my Personal Project. There is plenty of room for improvement on this website but for now I want to prove that I can make a working course site in the hopes that it could help someone have a more engaged view on learning to code.</p>
